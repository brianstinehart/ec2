          <h2>What is Ansible?</h2>
          <p>It&apos;s a <b>simple automation language</b> that can perfectly describe an IT application infrastructure in Ansible Playbooks.</p>
          <p>It&apos;s an <b>automation engine</b> that runs Ansible Playbooks.</p>
          <p>Ansible Tower is an <b>enterprise framework</b> for controlling, securing  and managing your Ansible automation with a <b>UI and RESTful API</b>.</p>
          <aside class="notes speaker">
            <p>Ansible is an automation platform:
              <ul>
                <li>Playbooks make up the automation language</li>
                <li>The code base is the automation engine.</li>
                <li>Ansible Tower manages existing automation</li>

            <h2>Ansible Is...</h2>
            <img src="images/simple-powerful-agentless-diagram.svg" />
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Ansible has a number of qualities that make it the most rapidly growing automation platform in the world. </p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is simple.</strong> Playbooks are human and machine readable, no special coding skills required &ndash; and even people in your IT organization that don’t know Ansible can read an Ansible playbook and understand what’s happening.</p>
              <p>This simplicity also means that it&rsquo;s easy to install and get started to do real work with it quickly &ndash; usually in just minutes. </p>
              <p>Ansible also works like you think &ndash; tasks are always executed in order. All together, the simplicity ensures that you can get started quickly.</p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is powerful.</strong> Simplicity is great, but to be really useful, you also need the powerful features that ensure you can model even the most complex of IT workflows.</p>
              <p>Ansible is complete automation, able to deploy apps, manage orchestration, and configure the infrastructure, networks, operating systems, and services that you’re already using today. </p>
              <p>Together, Ansible’s capabilities allow you to orchestrate the entire application and environment lifecycle, regardless of where It&apos;s deployed.</p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is Agentless.</strong>  Ansible relies on industry-standard and trusted SSH and WinRM protocols to automate. There are no agents or other software to install, and no additional firewall ports to open. With no need to separately stand up a management infrastructure, Ansible further reduces the activation energy required from your team to start automating today.</p>
              <p>In a world where IT complexity stymies even the most basic of IT tasks, Ansible provides a much needed respite &ndash; and path forward enabling teams to crush productivity-stealing complexity and overhead.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Playbooks are written in YAML and are used to invoke Ansible modules to perform tasks that are executed sequentially i.e top to bottom. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT workflow. Playbooks are like an instruction manual and describe the state of environment.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html">the Playbook page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>

            <p>If playbooks are the instruction manual for setting up and managing your infrastructure, Ansible modules are the tools in your toolkit.</p>
            <p>Modules are executable bits of code that operate on hosts; however, we don’t need to understand the underlying implementation to get them to work. Modules do the heavy-lifting in Ansible and abstract users from the complexity of the underlying details.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Continuing our metaphor, plugins are the gears in the engine.</p>
            <p>Plugins are pieces of code that extend Ansible’s core functionality. Ansible ships with a number of handy plugins, and you can easily write your own.</p>
            <p>These are some of the more common plugin types:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Action plugins manage the execution on the controller and deployment of modules to hosts.</li>
            <li>Callback plugins enable you to hook into Ansible events for display or logging purposes.</li>
            <li>Connection plugins define how to communicate with inventory hosts.</li>
            <li>Filters plugins allow you to manipulate data inside Ansible plays and/or templates. This is a Jinja2 feature; Ansible ships extra filter plugins.</li>
            </ul>

          <img src="images/how-ansible-works-diagram-05.svg" />
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Your inventory of hosts are your raw material. They are a list of nodes and associated meta data that Ansible can automate.</p>
            <p>Inventory lists can be built and stored several different ways, including static files, or can be dynamically-generated from an external source.</p>
            <p>You can also specify variables as part of an inventory list. For instance, set a particular host key that’s needed to log into that system remotely.  Inventories are ultimately lists of things you want to automate across.</p>
            <p>Here in this slide was see an example of a simple static inventory list of three hosts (webserver1, webserver2 and dbserver1) in two groups (web and db).</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In large-scale environment subject to constant change, synchronizing and maintaining inventory statically is tedious and error prone endeavor. That is why Ansible includes support of external sources such as public and private cloud providers and configuration management database (CMDB) systems.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>win_command</b>: Takes the command, sanitizes it, and executes it on the host. The most secure and predictable.</li>
            <li><b>win_shell</b>: Executes through a shell like <code>powershell.exe</code> so you can use pipes etc. Be careful.</li>
            <li><b>script</b>: Runs a local script on a remote node after transferring it.</li>
            <li><b>raw</b>: Executes a command without going through the Ansible module subsystem.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><b>NOTE:</b> Unlike standard modules, run commands have no concept of desired state and should only be used as a last resort.</p>

            <p>&quot;Run commands&quot; are what we collectively call these modules that enable users to do command-line operations in different ways. They’re a great catch all mechanism for getting things done, but they should be used sparingly and as a last resort. The reasons are many and varied.</p>
            <p>The overuse of run commands is common amongst those just becoming familiar with Ansible for automating their work. They use <code>shell</code> to fire off a bash command they already know without stopping to look at the Ansible docs. That works well enough initially, but it undermines the value of automating with Ansible and sets things up for problems down the road. <b>As a best practice, always check the hundreds of Ansible shipping modules for what you need and use those first and run commands as a last resort.</b></p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> <code>shell</code> allows for IO redirection such as pipes. This is why It&apos;s best practice to use <code>command</code> unless they need to pipe something. It also best practice to <strong>never</strong> pass user input or variables thru a run command.</p>

          <h2>Inventory</h2>
          <p>Inventory is a collection of hosts (nodes) with associated data and groupings that Ansible can connect and manage.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hosts (nodes)</li>
            <li>Groups</li>
            <li>Inventory-specific data (variables)</li>
            <li>Static or dynamic sources</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We've already discussed inventory in our review of Ansible's key components.</p>
            <p>Inventory consists of hosts, groups, inventory specific data. Inventory can either be static or dynamic.</p>
            <p>Inventory is a collection of the hosts (nodes) with associated metadata and groupings that Ansible can connect and manage. An inventory source can be static files or dynamically retrieved from an external system.</p>
            <p>You can specify a different inventory file using the <code>-i &lt;path&gt;</code> option on the command-line or your Ansible configuration file.</p>

          <h2>Static Inventory Example</h2>
          <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
10.42.0.2
10.42.0.6
10.42.0.7
10.42.0.8
10.42.0.100
host.example.com
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Static inventory is the easiest source to get started with. This example shows a static inventory source in It&rsquo;s simplest form &ndash; a single file with a list of IP addresses or hostnames.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Ansible infers a localhost is present even if it is not explicitly listed. This is why you can actually run Ansible without a inventory source. Ansible will only be able to operate on the localhost where it is being run.</p>

[web]
node-[1:3] ansible_host=10.42.0.[6:8]

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The example shown here is a more practical and common example of a static inventory file.</p>
            <p>Static inventory files are expressed in INI format. The headings in brackets are group names, which are used in classifying systems and deciding what systems you are controlling at what times and for what purpose. Hosts can belong to multiple groups and groups can be members of other groups. (The latter is not shown here.)</p>
            <p>NOTE: This example contains variables, a topic we haven't touched on just yet. We'll go into them on the next slide.</p>
            <p>Other noteworthy attributes in our example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>ansible_host</code> is an example of a host variable.</li>
              <li>Hosts can be assigned arbitrary human-meaningful names or aliases such as "control" and "haproxy". Ansible will instead use the value of <code>ansible_host</code> (one of several <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#magic-variables-and-how-to-access-information-about-other-hosts">&quot;magic&quot; inventory variables</a>) as the network address to connect.</li>
              <li>Static inventory files can support character ranges such as &quot;node-[1:3]&quot;</li>
              <li>Like localhost, Ansible infers an &quot;all&quot; group is present. As its name implies, all inventory hosts are members of this group.</li>
              <li>The heading &quot;all:vars&quot; is an example of group variable assignment using two more &quot;magic&quot; variables, <code>ansible_ssh_private_key_file</code> and <code>ansible_user</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This example just covers the basics. There's a lot more to inventory that is not covered here. See the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html">Ansible inventory documentation</a> for more details.</p>

              <h2>What is Ansible Tower?</h2>
              <p>Ansible Tower is an <strong>enterprise framework</strong> for controlling, securing and managing your Ansible automation – with a <strong>UI and RESTful API</strong></p><br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Role-based access control</strong> keeps environments secure, and teams efficient</li>
                <li>Non-privileged users can <strong>safely deploy</strong> entire applications with <strong>push-button deployment</strong> access</li>
                <li>All Ansible automations are <strong>centrally logged</strong>, ensuring <strong>complete auditability and compliance</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Red Hat Ansible Tower offers the control around Ansible automations in the form of RBAC, Job Scheduling, security abstraction from the user and API integrations with other systems.</p>
                <p>In Ansible Tower, all Ansible job launches are tracked and logged centrally. What was changed and when it was changed can be viewed, exported to other logging capabilities and controlled within allowances of a user's access based on role.</p>

              <p>Ansible Core brought you simple and powerful automation, Ansible Tower provides a visual interface to scale out that power. Run jobs against multiple inventories at the same time and schedule jobs to run when you want them too.</p>
              <p>With Core, everyone has their own playbooks stored locally or in their own SCM tool. With Ansible Tower, everyone's playbooks can be centralized to one location. Control what teams can see what with RBAC to resources and projects.</p>
              <p>Launch playbooks with the click of a button and see the expected results for that same job to compare and confirm the desired outcome.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Unlike Ansible Core, Ansible Tower cannot be installed locally on your laptop, it must be installed in a server environment.</p>
              <p>Other HTML5 compliant web browsers may work but are not fully tested or supported.</p>
              <p>10 GB of the 20 GB requirement must be dedicated to /var/, where Ansible Tower stores its files and working directories (dedicating less space will cause the installation to fail)</p>

              <p>We now have Ansible Tower installed on a VM, but before we can get started with automating in Ansible Tower, we need to learn how some of the key features of it work.</p>
              <p>Listed are some of the key features that we are going to be discussing in the coming slides. </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The Ansible Tower dashboard provides a heads-up NOC-style display and a friendly graphical framework for your IT orchestration needs. Across the top-left side of the Ansible Tower Dashboard, administrators can quickly navigate to their Projects, Inventories, Job Templates, and Jobs.</p>
              <p>Across the top-right side of this interface, administrators can access the tools they need to configure organizations, users, groups, and permissions as well as view related documentation, access portal mode, and log out.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>User Base</h2><br>
              <p>A <strong>user</strong> is an account to access Ansible Tower and its services given the permissions granted to it.</p>
              <p>An <strong>organization</strong> is a logical collection of users, teams, projects, inventories and more. All entities belong to an organization with the exception of users.</p>
              <p><strong>Teams</strong> provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations.</p>
              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Users are individuals and can be added to teams and or organizations. There are 3 types of users: Normal User, System Auditor and System Administrator.</p>
                <p>A normal user has read write access limited to the resources they are able to access.</p>
                <p>A system auditor implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the Ansible Tower environment.</p>
                <p>A system administrator (also known as Superuser) has admin, read, and write privileges over the entire Ansible Tower installation. A System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of Ansible Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various Users.
                <p>An organization is is a logical collection of Users, Teams, Projects, and Inventories, and is the highest level in the Ansible Tower object hierarchy.</p>
                <p>A Team is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, projects, credentials, and permissions. Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations. </p>
                <p>The user-base plays an important part in implementing role-based access control schemes across your organization.</p>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Credentials</h2>
            <p>Credentials are utilized by Ansible Tower for authentication with various external resources:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Connecting to <strong>remote machines</strong> to run jobs</li>
              <li>Syncing with <strong>inventory</strong> sources</li>
              <li>Importing project content from <strong>version control systems</strong></li>
              <li>Connecting to and managing <strong>networking devices</strong>
            </ul>
            <p>Centralized management of various credentials allows end users to leverage a  secret without ever exposing that secret to them.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Credentials are utilized by Ansible Tower for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.</p>
              <p>Ansible Tower credentials are imported and stored encrypted in Ansible Tower, and are not retrievable in plain text on the command line by any user.</p>
              <p>You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential to the user.</p>
              <p>If you have a user move to a different team or leave the organization, you don’t have to re-key all of your systems just because that credential was available in Ansible Tower.</p>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>Inventory is a collection of hosts (nodes) with associated data and groupings that Ansible Tower can connect to and manage.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hosts (nodes)</li>
              <li>Groups</li>
              <li>Inventory-specific data (variables)</li>
              <li>Static or dynamic sources</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
            <p>Inventory is a collection of the hosts (nodes) with associated metadata and groupings that Ansible can connect and manage. An inventory source can be static files or dynamically retrieved from an external system.</p>
            <p>In Ansible Tower, there are many features that you can take advantage of in regards to inventory. Groups, all be them not new in the Ansible space, are now more easily manipulated and created. Groups can be nested and this allows for you to copy or move the group to a different group.</p>
            <p>You also have the ability in Ansible Tower to setup a dynamic inventory within Ansible Tower. We will talk more in depth about dynamic inventories here in a few minutes.</p>
          </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Dynamic Inventory in Ansible Tower</h2>
            <p>Dynamic inventory is a script that queries a service, like a cloud provider API or a management application. This data is formatted in an Ansible-specific JSON data structure and is used in lieu of static inventory files.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Groups are generated based on host metadata</li>
              <li>Single source of truth saves time, avoids duplication and reduces human error</li>
              <li>Dynamic and static inventory sources can be used together</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Ansible can take inventory from a wide variety of sources on-the-fly. It can draw from many different systems such as VMWare, Openstack, Amazon EC2, Digital Ocean, and other provisioning systems like Cobbler. You can also create your own inventory module to interface with any proprietary or in-house CMDB systems.</p>
              <p>Ideally, the source of data for our dynamic inventory scripts is 100% correct, and is automatically updated as infrastructure changes. This is especially useful in environments where machines are coming on and offline all the time, like a cloud or virtual environment.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>A Project is a logical collection of Ansible Playbooks, represented in Ansible Tower.</p>
            <p>You can manage Playbooks and Playbook directories by placing them in a <strong>source code management system</strong> supported by Ansible Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.</li>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>As a refresher from the core presentation, a Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks. </p>
              <p>In Ansible Tower, you can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually under the Project Base Path on your Ansible Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by Ansible Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.</p>
              <p>Managing your projects with a SCM is recommended to ensure that only those with assigned access to the repository can change the playbook before execution, and for the extra layer of accountability and change control it provides.</p>
              <p>Within Ansible Tower, there are a few new things that you can do with your projects.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Update: If configured for a particular project, you can invoke an immediate update to source control.</li>
                <li>Schedule: If configured for a particular project , you can schedule an update from source control.</li>
                <li>Permissions: Any project can have permissions added to it so only a specific set of users or teams can access it.</li>
              </ul>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Job Templates</h2>
            <p>A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible Playbook. <br><br>Job templates are useful to <strong>execute</strong> the same job many times and encourage the <strong>reuse</strong> of Ansible Playbook content and collaboration between teams.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>While the REST API allows for the execution of jobs directly, Ansible Tower requires that you first create a job template.</p>
              <p>To create a job template, there are some things that are required. You will need to have:
                <ul>
                  <li>Name</li>
                  <li>Job Type</li>
                  <li>Inventory</li>
                  <li>Project</li>
                  <li>Playbook</li>
                  <li>Credentials (a machine credential is always required but depending on what you are running against, other credentials might be needed)</li>
                  <li>Verbosity Level (A level 0 is always selected by default but depending on the kind of output that is needed, you can select a level all the way up to 5)</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Those are required for a job template but their other options for you to cater each job template to your exact needs.</p>
              <p>Due to time, we won't go to far into the weeds on some of the advanced configurations that you can do with Job Templates but there are some options that you can select to make life a little easier when running job templates.</p>
              <p>Options such as Enable privilege escalation, enable provisioning callbacks and enable concurrent jobs.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Enable Privilege Escalation: If enabled, run this playbook as an administrator. This is the equivalent of passing the --become option to the ansible-playbook command.</li>
                  <li>Allow Provisioning Callbacks: Enable a host to call back to Ansible Tower via the Ansible Tower API and invoke the launch of a job from this job template.</li>
                  <li>Allow Provisioning Callbacks: Enable a host to call back to Ansible Tower via the Ansible Tower API and invoke the launch of a job from this job template.</li>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Jobs</h2>
            <p>A job is an instance of Ansible Tower launching an Ansible Playbook against an inventory of hosts.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Job results can be easily viewed</li>
                <li>View the standard out for a more in-depth look</li>
              </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The Jobs link displays a list of jobs and their status, shown as completed successfully or failed, or as an active (running) job.</p>
              <p>Actions you can take against jobs include viewing the details and standard output of a particular job, relaunch jobs, or remove jobs.</p>
              <p>Clicking on any type of job takes you to the Job Details View for that job, which consists of two sections:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Details: provides information and status about the job</li>
                  <li>Standard Out: displays the job processes and output</li>

            <h2>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</h2>
            <p>Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) are built into Ansible Tower and allow administrators to <strong>delegate access</strong> to server inventories, organizations, and more. These controls allow Ansible Tower to help you <strong>increase security</strong> and <strong>streamline management</strong> of your Ansible automation.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>RBAC is at the core of how Ansible Tower scales organizations while increasing the security of automating.</p>
              <p>By delegating access to resources within tower, you are removing an element of human error. Users can only view what they are permitted to see and can only run jobs against inventories that they are permitted to act against.</p>

            <h2>Ad-Hoc Commands</h2>
            <p>An ad-hoc command is a single Ansible task to perform quickly, but don’t want to save for later.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Ansible ad-hoc commands is a good place to start to understand the basics of what Ansible can do before learning how to use playbooks &ndash; ad-hoc commands can also be used to do quick things that you might not necessarily want to write a full playbook for.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, the true power of Ansible lies in playbooks. So why would you use ad-hoc tasks versus playbooks?</p>
              <p>For instance, if you wanted to restart a service on all of your lab nodes, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook.</p>

            <ul style="font-size: 0.75em;">
              <li><b>-m MODULE_NAME, --module-name=MODULE_NAME</b><br/>Module name to execute the ad-hoc command</li>
              <li><b>-a MODULE_ARGS, --args=MODULE_ARGS</b><br/>Module arguments for the ad-hoc command</li>
              <li><b>-b, --become</b><br/>Run ad-hoc command with elevated rights such as sudo, the default method</li>
              <li><b>-e EXTRA_VARS, --extra-vars=EXTRA_VARS</b><br/>Set additional variables as key=value or YAML/JSON</li>
              <li><b>--version</b><br/>Display the version of Ansible</li>
              <li><b>--help</b><br/>Display the MAN page for the Ansible tool</li>

            <h1>Workshop: Lesson 2<br/>Ad-Hoc Commands</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This brief exercise demonstrates Ansible in-action at it&apos;s most basic and simple level. Thru ad-hoc commands, students are exposed to Ansible modules and usage and will apply to their understanding of tasks and playbooks. This exercise also begins to expose students to the concepts of Ansible facts and inventory.</p>
              <p>This workshop is also a good way to verify their lab environments are properly configured before going forward.</p>
              <p>See <code>workshops/adhoc_commands</code> in the Ansible Lightbulb repo.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <p>Ansible can work with metadata from various sources and manage their context in the form of variables.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Command line parameters</li>
            <li>Plays and tasks</li>
            <li>Files</li>
            <li>Inventory</li>
            <li>Discovered facts</li>
            <li>Roles</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>While automation exists to make it easier to make things repeatable, all of your systems are not exactly alike.</p>
          <p>Variables are used to store metadata for each host drawing from numerous sources. For example variable may be for things like facts or file paths or package versions.</p>
        </aside>
        <section>
          <h2>Sidebar: Discovered Facts</h2>
          <p>Facts are bits of information derived from examining a host systems that are stored as variables for later use in a play.</p>
          <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
$ ansible localhost -m setup
localhost | success >> {
  "ansible_facts": {
      "ansible_default_ipv4": {
          "address": "192.168.1.37",
          "alias": "wlan0",
          "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
          "interface": "wlan0",
          "macaddress": "c4:85:08:3b:a9:16",
          "mtu": 1500,
          "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
          "network": "192.168.1.0",
          "type": "ether"
      },
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The second ad-hoc command example from the prior slide provides the following JSON output of a localhost facts run.</p>
            <p>Facts are bits of information derived from examining a host systems that are stored as variables for later use. An example of this might be the IP address of the host, or what operating system it is running. The facts Ansible will discover about a host is extensive. What's shown here is just a small sample. Run <code>ansible localhost -m setup</code> for a more complete representation.</p>
            <p>Ansible collects facts using the <code>setup</code> module. By default, Ansible will run the <code>setup</code> module before any other tasks are executed in a playbook. These facts can be referenced by subsequent automation tasks on a per host-basis during the playbook run.</p>

          <h2>Variable Precedence</h2>
          <p>The order in which the same variable from different sources will override each other.</p>
          <div class="columns">
            <div class="col">
              <ol>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>If variables of the same name are defined in multiple sources, they get overwritten in a certain and specific order. This is why this variable precedence is important to understand.</p>
            <p>There are 16 levels of variable precedence as of Ansible 2.x. The <code>extra_vars</code> (passed thru the command-line) always take precedence vs. role defaults which will always get overridden by any other source. The previous inventory example defines vars at 13 and 14 (highlighted in the list) in the variable precedence chain.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s a good idea to limit the different sources where a specific variable is being set. While Ansible's variable precedence handling is comprehensive and well-defined, it can laborious to keep the resolution of multiple sources straight.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The inventory variables sources showed in the static inventory example a couple of slides back are in bold type.</p>

          <h2>Tasks</h2>
          <p>Tasks are the application of a module to perform a specific unit of work.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>win_file</b>: A directory should exist</li>
            <li><b>win_package</b>: A package should be installed</li>
            <li><b>win_service</b>: A service should be running</li>
            <li><b>win_template</b>: Render a configuration file from a template</li>
            <li><b>win_get_url</b>: Fetch an archive file from a URL</li>
            <li><b>win_copy</b>: Copy a file from your repo or a remote source</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We've already reviewed modules, the batteries and tools Ansible provides. Tasks are the specific application of a module to perform a unit of automation.</p>

                <li>The first task assures the latest nginx package is installed using yum.</li>

          <h2>Handler Tasks</h2>
          <p>Handlers are special tasks that run at the end of a play if notified by another task when a change occurs.</p>
          <blockquote>If a package gets installed or updated, notify a service restart task that it needs to run.</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Normal tasks run sequentially; handler tasks run on notification of a change and will only run once at the end of a play.</p>
            <p>For more information see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html#handlers-running-operations-on-change">Handler Tasks</a>.</p>
          </aside>

tasks:
- name: Ensure IIS Server is present

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Here is our previous example with a few slight modifications that have been highlighted.</p>
            <p>In this version of our example, we add a <code>notify</code> keyword to the first task to trigger a handler task if it returns &quot;changed&quot; as being true. The third tasks now is under a &quot;handlers&quot; section that signifies that the handler task will run on notification at the end of the play of change occurs during the first task.</p>

          <h2>Plays &amp; Playbooks</h2>
          <p>Plays are ordered sets of tasks to execute against host selections from your inventory. A playbook is a file containing one or more plays.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Playbooks are text files that contain one or more plays that are expressed in YAML. A play defines target hosts and a task list that are executed sequentially (i.e top to bottom) to achieve a certain state on those hosts.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html">the Playbook page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>

    win_service:
      name: "{{ server_name }}"
      state: started</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Every play and each task in it can be assigned a name that describes its objective in the automation workflow and is output during execution.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s best practice to always name your plays and tasks. Adding name with a human-meaningful description better communicates the intent to users when running a play.</p>

      state: started</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The Ansible play host selector defines which nodes in the inventory the automation is targeting.</p>
            <p>In this example, a single group of &quot;web&quot; is being targeted. Ansible supports targeting intersections, unions and filters of multiple groups or hosts though.</p>

              <p>Templates are a vital feature provided by the Jinja2 template engine, a powerful piece of software independent of Ansible. Ansible makes this usage as seamless and transparent as possible. Most will not realize they are doing templating when they develop plays with Ansible.</p>
              <p>We don't show any specific template examples at the moment because we'll have plenty of opportunity to see templates in action as we cover other topics.</p>
              <p>In all actuality, what is covered here only touches upon a few of its most basic features. To go deeper see these docs:</p>

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>Loops can do one task on multiple things, such as create a lot of users, install a lot of packages, or repeat a polling step until a certain result is reached.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- name: Ensure IIS Server is present
  win_feature:
    name: <mark>&quot;{{ item }}&quot;</mark>
    state: present
  <mark>with_items:</mark>
  <mark>- Web-Server</mark>
  <mark>- NET-Framework-Core</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This example demonstrates a basic loop with <code>with_items</code>. The loop sets a variable called &quot;item&quot;, a template variable courtesy of the embedded Jinja2 template engine, with the list value that is in context.</p>
              <p>There are many different and specialized types of task loops to work with. See the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_loops.html">Loops documentation</a> to go deeper.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>Ansible supports the conditional execution of a task based on the run-time evaluation of variable, fact, or previous task result.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- name: Ensure IIS Server is present
  win_feature:
    name: Web-Server
    state: present
  <mark>when: ansible_os_family == &quot;Windows&quot;</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Conditionals are another instance of Jinja2 in action within Ansible plays themselves. In the provided example &quot;ansible_os_family&quot; is a fact variable Ansible will set.</p>
              <p>There are other forms of conditional clauses, but <code>when</code> is usually all that is needed.</p>
              <p>NOTE: Conditional clauses are considered to be raw Jinja2 expression without double curly braces.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Tags</h2>
            <p>Tags are useful to be able to run a subset of a playbook on-demand.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- name: Ensure IIS Server is present
  win_feature:
    name: <mark>&quot;{{ item }}&quot;</mark>
    state: present
  <mark>with_items:</mark>
  <mark>- Web-Server</mark>
  <mark>- NET-Framework-Core</mark>
  <mark>tags:</mark>
     <mark>- packages</mark>

- name: Copy web.config template to Server
  win_template:
    src: templates/web.config.j2
    dest: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
  <mark>tags:</mark>
     <mark>- configuration</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In the provided example, if the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;packages&quot;</code> the win_feature task would execute and the template task would be skipped. If the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;configuration&quot;</code> the opposite would happen. Without a <code>--tags</code> both tasks would execute like normal.</p>
              <p>Tags can be seen as a simple though specialized form of conditional statement designed to enable the execution of a subset tasks. Tags are a bit more than simple boolean flags though. To dig deeper see the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html">playbook Tags documentation</a>.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Blocks</h2>
            <p>Blocks cut down on repetitive task directives, allow for logical grouping of tasks and even in play error handling.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- <mark>block:</mark>
  - name: Ensure IIS Server is present
    win_feature:
      name: <mark>&quot;{{ item }}&quot;</mark>
      state: present
    <mark>with_items:</mark>
    <mark>- Web-Server</mark>

  - name: Copy web.config template to Server
    win_template:
      src: templates/web.config.j2
      dest: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config

  when: ansible_os_family == &quot;Windows&quot;
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In the provided example we use a block to group two tasks that are to be conditional executed if a host is running a Red Hat family linux using one conditional clause. In practice, we could have copied the <code>when</code> clause onto each task and gotten same result. Using a block, there is less clutter thereby less to maintain and nothing to keep in sync. The utility of using a block increases the more tasks and clauses are in use.</p>
              <p>Blocks have a play in error handling and automating roll backs that we won't get into here given the scope of that topic.</p>
              <p>See the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_blocks.html">documentation on blocks</a> to dig deeper.</p>

            <li>Improves readability and maintainability of complex plays</li>
            <li>Eases sharing, reuse and standardization of automation processes</li>
            <li>Enables Ansible content to exist independently of playbooks, projects -- even organizations</li>

                <p>Here students are tasked with refactoring their previous work from the Practical Playbook workshop into a role and modifying their playbook accordingly. We intentionally avoid introducing any new tasks or functionality otherwise. The objective here is to focus students specifically on how roles are structured and develop.</p>
                <p>You should emphasize the value of roles in better organizing playbooks as they grow in sophistication and making Ansible automation more portable and reusable than a basic playbook.</p>
