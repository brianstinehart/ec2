= Exercise 5 - Using Variables, Loops, and Handlers


Previous exercises showed you the basics of Ansible playbooks.  In the next few exercises, we are going
to teach some more advanced ansible skills that will add flexibility and power to your playbooks.

Ansible exists to make tasks simple and repeatable.  We also know that not all systems are exactly alike and often require
some slight change to the way an Ansible playbook is run.  Enter variables.

Variables are how we deal with differences between your systems, allowing you to account for a change in port, IP address
or directory.

Loops enable us to repeat the same task over and over again.  For example, lets say you want to start multiple services, install several features, or create multiple directories.
By using an ansible loop, you can do that in a single task.

Handlers are the way in which we restart services.  Did you just deploy a new config file, install a new package?
If so, you may need to restart a service for those changes to take effect.  We do that with a handler.

For a full understanding of variables, loops, and handlers; check out our Ansible documentation on these subjects. +

== Section 1: Creating the Playbook


To begin, we are going to create a new playbook, but it should look very familiar to the one you created in exercise 3


=== Step 1:

Within Visual Studio Code, create a new directory in your git repo and create a site.yml file.

In the Explorer accordion you should have a 'student#' section where you previously made iis_basic.

image::images/3-vscode-create-folders.png[title="Student Playbooks",width=1000]

=== Step 2: Create a folder called *iis_advanced* and a file called `site.yml`

Hover over the 'student#' section and click on the 'New Folder' button

Type iis_advanced and hit enter.  Then click on that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the 'student#' section again and click on the 'New File' button.

Type site.yml and hit enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your playbook.

image::images/5-vscode-create-folders.png[title="Empty site.yml",width=400]


=== Step 3:

Add a play definition and some variables to your playbook.  These include addtional packages your playbook will install on your web servers, plus some web server specific configurations.

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: Windows
  name: This is a play within a playbook
  vars:
    iis_sites:
      - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test'
        port: '8080'
        path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest'
      - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test 2'
        port: '8081'
        path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest2'
    iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"
----


=== Step 4:

Add a new task called *install IIS*.

[source,bash]
----
  tasks:
    - name: Install IIS
      win_feature:
        name: Web-Server
        state: present

    - name: Create site directory structure
      win_file:
        path: "{{ item.path }}"
        state: directory
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

    - name: Create IIS site
      win_iis_website:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        state: started
        port: "{{ item.port }}"
        physical_path: "{{ item.path }}"
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
      notify: restart iis service
----

image::images/5-vscode-iis-yaml.png[title="site.yml part 1",width=1000]


[NOTE]
====
*What is happening here!?* +

- `vars:` You've told Ansible the next thing it sees will be a variable name +
- `iis_sites` You are defining a list-type variable called iis_sites.  What follows
is a list of each site with it's related variables +
- `file:` This module is used to create, modify, delete files, directories, and symlinks.
- `{{ item }}` You are telling Ansible that this will expand into a list item.  Each item has several variables like `name`, `port`, and `path`. +
- `with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}` This is your loop which is instructing Ansible to perform this task on
every `item` in `iis_sites`
- `notify: restart iis service` This statement is a `handler`, so we'll come back to it in Section 3.
====


== Section 2: Opening Firewall and Deploying Files

When you need to do pretty much anything with files and directories, use one of the link:{file_url}[Ansible Files] modules.  We already used the `win_file` module to create our directory.  Next we'll leverage the `win_template` modules to create a dynamic file using variables.

After that, you will define a task to start the IIS service.


=== Step 1:
Create a `templates` directory in your project directory and create a template as follows:

Ensure your *iis_advanced folder* is highlighted and then hover over the 'student#' section and click on the 'New Folder' button

Type templates and hit enter.  Then click on that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the 'templates' folder and click on the 'New File' button.

Type index.html.j2 and hit enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your template.  Enter the following details:

[source,bash]
----
<html>
<body>

  <p align=center><img src='http://docs.ansible.com/images/logo.png' align=center>
  <h1 align=center>{{ ansible_hostname }} --- {{ iis_test_message }}

</body>
</html>

----

image::images/5-vscode-template.png[title="index.html template",width=1000]

=== Step 2:
Add to your playbook, `site.yml`, opening your firewall ports and writing the template.  Use single quotes for win_template in order to not escape the forward slash.

[source,bash]
----
    - name: Open port for site on the firewall
      win_firewall_rule:
        name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
        enable: yes
        state: present
        localport: "{{ item.port }}"
        action: Allow
        direction: In
        protocol: Tcp
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

    - name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
      win_template:
        src: 'index.html.j2'
        dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
----

[NOTE]
====
*So... what did I just write?*

- `win_firewall_rule:` This module is used to create, modify, and update firewall rules.  Note in the case of AWS there are also security group rules which may impact communication.  We've opened these for the ports in this example.
- `win_template:` This module specifies that a jinja2 template is being used and deployed.
- *jinja-who?* - Not to be confused with 2013's blockbuster "Ninja II - Shadow of a Tear", link:{jinja2_url}[jinja2] is
used in Ansible to transform data inside a template expression, i.e. filters.
====


== Section 3: Defining and Using Handlers

There are any number of reasons we often need to restart a service/process including the deployment of a configuration file, installing a new package, etc.  There are really two parts to this Section; adding a handler to the playbook and calling the handler after the a task.  We will start with the former.

=== Step 1:
Define a handler.

[source,bash]
----
  handlers:
    - name: restart iis service
      win_service:
        name: W3Svc
        state: restarted
        start_mode: auto
----

[NOTE]
====
*You can't have a former if you don't mention the latter*

- `handler:` This is telling the *play* that the `tasks:` are over, and now we are defining `handlers:`.
  Everything below that looks the same as any other task, i.e. you give it a name, a module, and the options for that
  module.  This is the definition of a handler.
- `notify: restart iis service` ...and here is your latter. Finally!  The `notify` statement is the invocation of a handler by
name.  Quite the reveal, we know.   You already noticed that you've added a `notify` statement to the `win_iis_website`
task, now you know why.
====

== Section 4: Commit and Review

Your new, improved playbook is done! But remember we still need to commit the changes to source code control.

Click `File` -> `Save All` to save the files you've written

image::images/5-vscode-iis-yaml-2.png[title="site.yml part 2"]

Click on the Source Code icon, type in a commit message such as 'Adding basic playbook', and click the check box above.

image::images/5-commit.png[title="Commit site.yml"]

Sync to gitlab by clicking the arrows on the lower left blue bar.  When prompted, click `OK` to push and pull commits.

image::images/5-push.png[title="Push to Gitlab.yml"]

It should take 5-30 seconds to finish the commit.  The blue bar should stop rotating and indicate 0 problems...


Now let's take a second look to make sure everything looks the way you intended.  If not, now is the time for us to fix it up. The figure below shows line counts and spacing.


[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: Windows
  name: This is a play within a playbook
  vars:
    iis_sites:
      - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test'
        port: '8080'
        path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest'
      - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test 2'
        port: '8081'
        path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest2'
    iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"

  tasks:
    - name: Install IIS
      win_feature:
        name: Web-Server
        state: present

    - name: Create site directory structure
      win_file:
        path: "{{ item.path }}"
        state: directory
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

    - name: Create IIS site
      win_iis_website:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        state: started
        port: "{{ item.port }}"
        physical_path: "{{ item.path }}"
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
      notify: restart iis service

    - name: Open port for site on the firewall
      win_firewall_rule:
        name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
        enable: yes
        state: present
        localport: "{{ item.port }}"
        action: Allow
        direction: In
        protocol: Tcp
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

    - name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
      win_template:
        src: 'index.html.j2'
        dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

  handlers:
    - name: restart iis service
      win_service:
        name: W3Svc
        state: restarted
        start_mode: auto

== Section 5: Create your Job Template

=== Step 1:

Before we can create our Job Template, you must first go resync your Project again.  So do that now.  
____
``*NOTE*: You must do this anytime you create a new 'base' playbook file that you will be selecting via a Job Template.  The new file must be synced to Tower before it will become available in the Job Template playbook dropdown.``
____

=== Step 2:
To test this playbook, we need to create a new Job Template to run this playbook.  So goto 'Template' and click 'Add' again.

Complete the form using the following values

|===
|NAME |IIS Advanced
|DESCRIPTION|Template for iis_advanced
|JOB TYPE|Run
|INVENTORY|Ansible Workshop Inventory
|PROJECT|Ansible Workshop Project
|PLAYBOOK|iis_advanced/site.yml
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|LIMIT|Windows
|OPTIONS
a|
- [*] Use Fact Cache
|===

=== Step 3:

Click SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Save] and then select ADD SURVEY image:images/at_add_survey.png[Add]

=== Step 4:

Complete the survey form with following values

|===
|PROMPT|Please enter a test message for your new website
|DESCRIPTION|Website test message prompt
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|iis_test_message
|ANSWER TYPE|Text
|MINIMUM/MAXIMUM LENGTH| Use the defaults

=== Step 5:

Select ADD image:images/at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 6:

Select SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 7:

Back on the main Job Template page, select SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Add,35,25] again.


== Section 6: Running your new playbook

Now let's run it and see how it works.


=== Step 1:

Select TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 2:

Click on the rocketship icon image:images/at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *IIS Advanced* Job Template.

=== Step 3:

When prompted, enter your desired test message

After it launches, you should be redirected and can watch the output of the job in realtime. 

Once your job is sucessful, navigate to your new websites (replace # with your student number)
