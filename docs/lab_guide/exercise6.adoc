= Exercise 6 - Roles: Making your playbooks reusable


While it is possible to write a playbook in one file as we've done throughout this workshop, eventually you'll want to reuse files and start to organize things.

Ansible Roles is the way we do this.  When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure.  This is considered best practice and will save you a lot of time in the future.


For this exercise, you are going to take the playbook you just wrote and refactor it into a role.

Let's begin with seeing how your iis-basic-playbook will break down into a role...

== Section 1: Create directory structure for your new role

=== Step 1:

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to explorer and your `student#` project where you previously made iis_advanced.

image::images/5-create-folder.png[title="iis_advanced",width=1000]

Select the *iis_advanced* folder.

Create a directory called *roles*  by right-clicking on iis_advanced and selecting 'New Folder'

Now right-click on *roles* and create a new folder underneath called `iis_simple`.

=== Step 2:

Within 'iis_simple' create new folders as follows:

  * defaults
  * vars
  * handlers
  * tasks
  * templates

=== Step 3:

Within each of these new folders (except templates), right-click and create 'New File'
Create a file called `main.yml` in each of these folders.  You will not do this under templates as we will create individual template files.  This is your basic role structure and main.yml will be the default file that the role will use for each section.

The finished structure will look like this:

image::images/6-create-role.png[title="Role Structure",width=1000]

== Section 2: Breaking Your `site.yml` Playbook into the Newly Created `iis_simple` Role

In this section, we will separate out the major parts of your playbook including `vars:`, `tasks:`, `template:`, and `handlers:`.

=== Step 1:

Make a backup copy of `site.yml`, then create a new `site.yml`.

Navigate to your `iis_advanced` folder, right click on `site.yml`, click `rename`, and call it `site.yml.backup`

Create a blank new file called `site.yml` in the same folder

=== Step 2:

Update site.yml to look like to only call your role.  It should look like below:

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: Windows
  name: This is my role-based playbook

  roles:
    - iis_simple
----

image::images/6-new-site.png[title="New site.yml",width=1000]

=== Step 3:

Add a default variable to your role.  Edit the `roles\iis_simple\defaults\main.yml` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
---
# defaults file for iis_simple
iis_sites:
  - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test'
    port: '8080'
    path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest'
  - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test 2'
    port: '8081'
    path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest2'
----

=== Step 4:

Add some role-specific variables to your role in `roles\iis_simple\vars\main.yml`.

[source,bash]
----
---
# vars file for iis_simple
iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"
----

[NOTE]
====
*Hey, wait... did we just put variables in two seperate places?* +

Yes... yes we did.  Variables can live in quite a few places.  Just to name a few: +

- vars directory
- defaults directory
- group_vars directory
- In the playbook under the `vars:` section
- In any file which can be specified on the command line using the `--extra_vars` option
- On a boat, in a moat, with a goat  _(disclaimer:  this is a complete lie)_

Bottom line, you need to read up on link:{var_prec_url}[variable precedence] to understand both where to define variables and which locations take precedence.  In this exercise, we are using role defaults to define a couple of variables and these are the most malleable.  After that, we defined some variables in `/vars`
which have a higher precedence than defaults and can't be overridden as a default variable.
====

=== Step 5:

Create your role handler in `roles\iis_simple\handlers\main.yml`.

[source,bash]
----
---
# handlers file for iis_simple
- name: restart iis service
  win_service:
    name: W3Svc
    state: restarted
    start_mode: auto
----

=== Step 6:

Add tasks to your role in `roles\iis_simple\tasks\main.yml`.

[source,bash]
----
---
# tasks file for iis_simple

- name: Install IIS
  win_feature:
    name: Web-Server
    state: present

- name: Create site directory structure
  win_file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: directory
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

- name: Create IIS site
  win_iis_website:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: started
    port: "{{ item.port }}"
    physical_path: "{{ item.path }}"
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
  notify: restart iis service

- name: Open port for site on the firewall
  win_firewall_rule:
    name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
    enable: yes
    state: present
    localport: "{{ item.port }}"
    action: Allow
    direction: In
    protocol: Tcp
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

- name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
  win_template:
    src: 'index.html.j2'
    dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
----

=== Step 7:

Add your index.html template.

Right-click on `roles\iis_simple\templates` and create a new file called `index.html.j2` with the following content:

[source,bash]
----
<html>
<body>

  <p align=center><img src='http://docs.ansible.com/images/logo.png' align=center>
  <h1 align=center>{{ ansible_hostname }} --- {{ iis_test_message }}

</body>
</html>
----

Now, remember we still have a 'templates' folder at the base level of this playbook, so we will delete that now.  Right Click on it and Select 'Delete'.

=== Step 8: Commit
Click on File -> Save All to ensure all your files are saved.

Click on the Source Code icon as shown below.

Type in a commit message like `Add iis_simple role` and click the check box above.

image::images/6-commit.png[title="Commit iis_simple_role",width=1000]

Click on the `synchronize changes` button on the blue bar at the bottom left (and click `OK`).  This should again return with no problems.



== Section 3: Running your new playbook

Now that you've successfully separated your original playbook into a role, let's run it and see how it works.
We don't need to create a new template, as we are re-using the one from Exercise 5.  When we run the template again, it
will automatically refresh from git and launch our new role.


=== Step 1:

Before we can modify our Job Template, you must first go resync your Project again.  So do that now.  

=== Step 2:

Select TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 3:

Click on the rocketship icon image:images/at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *IIS Advanced* Job Template.

=== Step 4:

When prompted, enter your desired test message

If successful, your standard output should look similar to the figure below.  Note that most of the tasks return OK because we've previously configured the servers and services are already running.

Once your job is sucessful, navigate again to your websites to verify they are still working (replace # with your student number)

== Section 5: Review

You should now have a completed playbook, `site.yml` with a single role called `iis_simple`.  The advantage of structuring your playbook into roles is that you can now add reusability to your playbooks as well as simplifying changes to variables, tasks, templates, etc.  link:{galaxy_url}[Ansible Galaxy] is a good repository of roles for use or reference.
